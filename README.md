## üìñ Project Overview

Water pollution is a significant environmental and public health challenge worldwide. This project tackles **Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation)** by leveraging **unsupervised machine learning** to analyze water quality data and identify pollution hotspots across different regions. 

Using **K-means clustering**, regions with similar water quality profiles are grouped together, enabling policymakers and environmental agencies to prioritize interventions and allocate resources more effectively.

## üéØ Problem Statement

Access to clean and safe water is fundamental to health, yet water contamination remains pervasive due to industrial waste, agricultural runoff, and poor sanitation. Traditional monitoring methods are resource-intensive and often lack timely insights.

**Goal:** Automate the identification of polluted water regions through data-driven clustering techniques to facilitate targeted cleanup and sustainable water management.

## üìÇ Dataset

- **Source:** [Water Potability Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sogun3/water-potability)  
- **Description:** Contains physicochemical water quality metrics such as pH, hardness, solids, chloramines, sulfate, conductivity, organic carbon, trihalomethanes, turbidity, and a potability label.  
- **Preprocessing:**  
  - Handled missing values by removing incomplete records  
  - Selected relevant features for clustering  
  - Normalized features using standard scaling

## üöÄ Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing  
- Clean and filter data to remove missing or inconsistent entries  
- Select key chemical indicators relevant for water quality  
- Normalize features to bring them to a comparable scale  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Visualize distributions and correlations between variables  
- Detect potential outliers and anomalies  

### 3. Model Training: K-means Clustering  
- Use the Elbow method to determine optimal number of clusters  
- Apply K-means to group regions into distinct clusters based on water quality  
- Assign cluster labels to each data point  

### 4. Results Visualization  
- Plot clusters with respect to key features (e.g., pH vs. sulfate)  
- Analyze cluster characteristics and interpret pollution levels

## üìä Results

- Identified **3 distinct clusters** representing different water quality profiles:  
  - **Cluster 0:** High pollution indicators  
  - **Cluster 1:** Moderate contamination  
  - **Cluster 2:** Relatively clean water  

- Visualizations confirm the model‚Äôs ability to segregate data based on chemical signatures.

- These clusters provide actionable insights for environmental monitoring teams to focus remediation efforts.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Ethical Considerations

- **Data Bias:** The dataset may underrepresent certain geographic areas, especially rural or under-monitored regions, which could limit generalizability.  
- **Fairness:** Clustering results must be used responsibly to avoid unfairly labeling or stigmatizing communities.  
- **Sustainability:** Encourages data-driven environmental policies to promote equitable access to clean water.
